    "\n",
    "#### Treat data as read only\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. \n",
    "Data is typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. \n",
    "Working with them interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection. \n",
    "It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as “read-only”.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Cleaning\n",
    "In many cases your data will be “dirty”: it will need significant preprocessing to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "This task is sometimes called “data munging”.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find it useful to store these scripts in a separate folder, and create a second “read-only” data folder to hold the “cleaned” data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Treat generated output as disposable\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of different ways to manage this output. \n",
    "\n",
    "I find it useful to have an output folder with different sub-directories for each separate analysis. \n",

    "This makes it easier later, as many of my analyses are exploratory and don’t end up being used in the final project, and some of the analyses get shared between projects."
